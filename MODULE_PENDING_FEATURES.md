## Conclusion

The PI System has a solid foundation with **well-architected backend services** and **comprehensive entity models**. However, there is significant work pending across all modules, primarily in:

1. **Frontend Development** - Biggest gap (0% in most modules)
2. **Database Tables** - Tax module needs immediate attention
3. **API Testing** - Critical for production readiness
4. **Advanced Features** - Analytics, reports, notifications

**Recommendation**: Focus on completing frontend dashboards for all modules first to provide immediate user value, then iterate with advanced features and comprehensive testing.
